Pyrsomes are actually colonies of small jellyfish creating a whole. I thought that was a fun way to think about group creative projects. In a way this tool helps multiple people be part of a whole, and because it's houdini, life, mathematics and growth are common insterests of houdini artists.

# Houdini Pipeline Tool

This was developed for my needs during my senior project using Houdini with a small team. I needed to ensure the project enviornment was the same accross computers and platforms. Additionally I needed a way to run the tool on it's own without needing to configure each computers python enviornment.

# TODO

- Refactor main file into a library to clean up code
- Build standalone app for each platform

# Future goals
- add support for game projects with unity and unreal and possibly godot



- possible branch project name pyrasoma?
